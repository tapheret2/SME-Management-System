# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 03, 2026**

Peganyx, Inc. ("we", "us", or "our") operates the Peganyx SME Management System (the "Software"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information when you use our Software.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

The Software is primarily designed to be self-hosted or deployed within your own infrastructure. Therefore, Peganyx, Inc. generally does **not** collect, store, or process your business data, customer data, or financial records stored within the Software instance running on your servers.

However, if you contact us for support or purchase license keys, we may collect:
*   Contact Information (Name, Email, Phone number)
*   Billing Information

## 2. Log Data

When you access the Software, the system generates logs locally on your server. We do not have access to these logs unless you explicitly share them with us for troubleshooting purposes.

## 3. Data Security

The Software includes security features such as encryption and role-based access control. However, as a self-hosted or on-premise solution, the security of the data also depends on the security of the infrastructure where you deploy the Software.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

## 5. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at support@peganyx.com.
